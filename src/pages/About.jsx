                    <h2>The Vision of the Church</h2>
                    <p>
                        The vision of the Philadelphia Evangelical Eritrean Church is to spread the Gospel to the ends of
                        the earth, carrying the cross of Christ and proclaiming the good news of the Lord Jesus. The
                        church seeks to:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Unite believers from Eritrea and other parts of the world, both within and beyond the city
                              of Columbus and to faithfully witness and spread the gospel locally and globally.</li>
                          <li>Rooted in the Word of God and empowered by the Holy Spirit, the church is committed
                              to reaching the Tigrinya-speaking community in Columbus—as well as the Eritrean
                              people in Eritrea, making believers into true followers and disciples of Christ.</li>
                          <li>In obedience to Scripture, the church desires to walk in fellowship with all believers and
                              partner with churches that share a common faith and calling, extending the right hand of
                              fellowship.</li>
                        </ul>
                        The Philadelphia Evangelical Eritrean Church of Columbus, Ohio is guided by the Word of God
                        and the full counsel of the Lord. The theme verse of the church is:
                    </p>
                    <p><em>“I know your works. See, I have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it; for you
                       have a little strength, have kept My word, and have not denied My name.”</em>
                    </p>

                    <h2>A Brief History of the Philadelphia
                        Evangelical Eritrean Church, Columbus, OH</h2>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Preface</h3>
                        The Philadelphia Evangelical Eritrean Church in Columbus, Ohio, acknowledges Christ as its ultimate
                        founder and head. This booklet recounts the church’s humble beginnings, growth, spiritual milestones,
                        leadership appointments, and partnerships with other churches. It is written to glorify God, honor the
                        faithfulness of the founding members, and serve as a historical record for future generations.
                        <h3>The Humble Beginnings</h3>
                        In 2008, the Columbus area was home to only a small number of Tigrinya-speaking believers, most of
                        whom worshiped in English- or Amharic-speaking congregations. During that year, these
                        believers—including the families of Tesfu Tesfazgi, Ruth Aynom, Tirhas Yebiyo, Yerusalem Haile,
                        Samuel Habte, Tetan Haile, Isaak Abraham, and others—began to intentionally gather for fellowship.
                        Though many were still young in their faith, God providentially brought them together and used them to
                        lay the foundation of what would become the Philadelphia Evangelical Eritrean Church. In its earliest
                        stage, the fellowship met in private homes, marking the humble beginnings of the church.
                        In retrospect, the founding members acknowledge that they came together with sincerity and love, yet
                        with limited understanding of God’s Word and the ordinances of the church. Despite this spiritual
                        immaturity and timidity, God, in His grace, looked upon their weakness and used them for His purposes.
                        The early fellowship was marked by joy and gratitude as many brothers joined during that season. These
                        believers began meeting regularly in their homes—particularly on Saturdays—for prayer and discipleship.
                        Above all, there remains deep thanksgiving to God that those who walked together in this fellowship have
                        continued to walk faithfully in the house of God, abiding in the Lord.
                        To the glory of God, the number of souls began to increase, and the house-to-house gatherings expanded
                        and multiplied. As the fellowship continued to grow, a formal choir and worship leaders were organized,
                        marking the beginning of regular and structured worship services.
                        In addition to the Saturday prayers and teaching gatherings, the fellowship maintained relationships with
                        various ministers through different forms of collaboration. Through these connections, the believers
                        received instruction, guidance, and counsel. The church expresses heartfelt gratitude to the ministers who
                        played a significant role in nurturing and supporting this fellowship, and offers its blessing in testimony
                        that their labor has not been in vain.
                        During this period, the servants of the fellowship proposed various names for the church, but no
                        consensus was reached. Eventually, the name “Philadelphia,” meaning brotherly love, was suggested and

                        received unanimous agreement. Accordingly, the fellowship adopted the name Philadelphia Evangelical
                        Eritrean Church of Columbus, Ohio.
                        The history of the Philadelphia Evangelical Church is not the result of one individual or a single event,
                        but of many brothers, sisters, and ministers—their prayers, service, efforts, and patience. We say
                        Ebenezer, for God has supported us to this day in every circumstance.
                        <h3>God’s Promises for the Church</h3>
                        During this period, many ministers prophesied that God would provide a pastor and raise up leaders from
                        within the fellowship. Several pastors testified that they saw a great light in the church and a harvest of
                        souls coming to salvation. Members of the fellowship also received visions concerning the growth of the
                        church. In time, these promises and assurances were fulfilled as the church continued to grow and mature.
                        God raised Pastor Negga Woldesemaet to shepherd and lead the congregation. Additionally, many
                        ministers moved to Columbus and joined the church, becoming the founders of several ministries that
                        continue to serve the fellowship.
                        As the fellowship multiplied, the homes that once hosted gatherings could no longer accommodate the
                        congregation, prompting the search for a larger meeting place. Leaders were appointed to serve as elders
                        of the fellowship.
                        <h3>Important Milestones</h3>
                        In September 2010, the church officially began holding its services at the Bethany Lutheran Church
                        building, where it continued to meet until the end of 2015. Beginning in early 2016, the church started
                        holding its services at The Cross Walk Church building.
                        In December 2012, the fellowship was formally recognized as a legal church.
                        As the Philadelphia Evangelical Church continued to grow as a fellowship, ministers and believers were
                        added from various parts of the world. Particularly during the period from 2010 to 2014, the church
                        earnestly prayed for God to provide ministers. In time, God answered these prayers, and the arrival of
                        these ministers brought great relief, stability, and spiritual encouragement to the Philadelphia church.
                        <h3>Appointment and Ordination of Leaders</h3>
                        Since July 2017, Pastor Negga Woldesemaet has been appointed to serve as the pastor of the church and
                        continues in this role in obedience to the Lord’s call. Pastor Negga, together with four elected elders,
                        leads the church. While leadership is shared, the pastor bears primary responsibility for the spiritual
                        affairs of the congregation. Pastor Negga Woldesemaet has been serving the Lord since his childhood in
                        Eritrea and Ethiopia. He holds a Master of Divinity degree from Asbury Theological Seminary.
                        In 2021, the church recognized and ordained Pastor Mulugeta Megisteab as a church teacher, affirming
                        the grace God has given him to teach the Word of God. During the same period, Evangelist Paulos
                        Gebremariam was recognized and ordained as an evangelist, acknowledging God’s call upon his life to
                        proclaim the gospel.

                        <h3>Relationships with Other Churches</h3>
                        The Philadelphia Evangelical Church functions as an independent congregation under the Christian and
                        Missionary Alliance (C&amp;MA) as an observing partner, though not a full member. Through this
                        partnership, the congregation has received recognition and fellowship.
                        The church is also a member of the Union of Churches of North America and the Union of African
                        Churches in the United States. In addition, it maintains strong and cooperative relationships with other
                        Eritrean churches—both within the United States and in Eritrea—and enjoys close fellowship with local
                        Ethiopian churches in Columbus.
                        <h3>Legacy and Thanksgiving</h3>
                        The Philadelphia Evangelical Eritrean Church stands as a testimony of God’s faithfulness. Its growth is
                        the result of the prayers, dedication, and service of countless members, ministers, and leaders. From its
                        humble beginnings in private homes to its recognition as a legal church and the establishment of
                        ministries, God’s hand has been evident throughout.
                        All glory and thanksgiving are given to God for His guidance, provision, and protection, and for raising
                        up leaders to shepherd His flock. The church continues to proclaim the gospel, nurture believers, and
                        serve the community in obedience to Christ.
                        We say Ebenezer—“God has helped us to this day.”
